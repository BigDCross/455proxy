Running:
To test the proxy out run Main.py (using python3)
then put in the proxy address in a browser

TODO:
- Parse argv for host, port, and other config options (easy)
- Recv better. HTTP messages have no end-of-msg marker. You must
    instead parse the headers (that is, until '\r\n\r\n' is found)
    then use the Content-Length header (or handle chunked encoding)
    to recv the rest of the message. (hard)
- Work on parsing and building HTTP messages. There is some basic
    functionality in HTTP_Utils. (tricky I suspect)
- Figure out how the client is supposed to send the initial request.
    Maybe send a page with an input box for a URL?
- Error checking. This is super important.

- Did I mention error checking?
